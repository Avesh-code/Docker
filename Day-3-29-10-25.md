# Docker Documentation  
## 1. Docker compose
* Docker Compose is a tool used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you define your application's services, networks, and volumes in a YAML file, typically called docker-compose.yml

| Command             | Description                                                        |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `docker compose up`  | Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service. |
| `docker compose down`| Stops and removes containers, networks, volumes, and images created by `up`. |
| `docker compose build`| Builds or rebuilds services.                                      |
| `docker compose ps`  | Lists containers related to your Compose project.                  |
| `docker compose logs`| Fetches logs for all or specific containers.                       |  
| `docker compose up -d` | It will start in detached mode                                   |    

* also used the Docker composed in two tier project and written the `docker-compose.yml` file and run it using commands so here is the docker compose file.

```
* some commands for deleting images and containers
```
# for deleting one image
docker rmi <imageid>
# for deleting multi images
docker rmi <imageid> <imageid>
# for deleting all images
docker rmi -f $(docker images -aq)
# for deleting one comtainer 
docker rm <containerid>
# for deleting multi containers
docker remove <containerid> <containerid>
# for deleting all containers
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```
## 1. Docker registry  

* 1. Login to dockerhub using cli
```
docker login
```
> NOTE : login using a PAT (personal access token)
* 2. tag the docker image
```
docker image tag <image-name> <username>/<new-image-name>:lattest
```
> NOTE : the username should of Docker hub account
* 3. push the image to docker hub
```
docker push <username>/<new-image-name>:lattest
```
