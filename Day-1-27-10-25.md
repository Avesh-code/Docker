# Docker Documentation  
## 1. Introduction To Docker
### What is Docker?  
* Docker is a tool that lets you package an application together with everything it needs (like code, libraries, and system tools) into a single lightweight unit called a container, so it can run the same way on any computer.
### What is Container?
* Containers are isolated environments—like mini-computers inside your computer—that keep your app and its dependencies separate from everything else.
* This makes it much easier to develop, test, and deploy software consistently across different setups without compatibility issues.
### What is Docker Image?
* A Docker image is like a blueprint or recipe for creating a container. It includes everything your app needs to run—code, tools, libraries, and settings—all packed into one file.
* You can't run an image by itself; you use it to create a container, which is the running, live version of that blueprint.
## 2. Docker Architecture  
### Docker Engine 
* This is the core software running on the Docker Host. It is a client-server application made up of the Docker daemon (server), the Docker API, and the Docker CLI (client). The Docker Engine is responsible for building, running, and managing containers on the Docker Host.
### Docker Daemon  
* Docker daemon is like the brain of Docker running silently in the background, handling all the work of running and managing containers behind the scenes. The user talks to the Docker daemon through the CLI, but the daemon is the one actually doing the container management.
### Docker CLI  
* The Docker CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool you use to interact with Docker from your terminal or command prompt. It lets you control and manage Docker containers, images, networks, and other Docker resources by typing commands.
### Docker Desktop  
* Docker Desktop is the all-in-one tool designed for developers to use Docker easily on their local Windows or Mac machines, combining command-line tools, GUI, orchestration, and more in one package.
* It uses API to show containers.

## 3. Docker Installation  
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io
# for checking the service is running or not
sudo systemctl status docker

# now if we use `docker ps` then it gets permission denied error so for that we have to add current user to docker group using this command
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# to refres the config use command
newgrp docker
```
so now the docker is successfully installed and working.  

## 4. Virtualization vs Containerzation  
| Virtualization                            | Containerization                        |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Running multiple virtual machines with full guest OS on physical hardware using a hypervisor. | Running multiple isolated containers sharing the host OS kernel to run applications. |
| Uses a hypervisor to create and manage virtual machines. | Does not use a hypervisor; containers share the host OS kernel directly. |
| Heavyweight: each VM includes a full OS instance, consuming more system resources. | Lightweight: containers share OS kernel, using fewer resources and starting faster. |

## 5. Docker Images  
* A Docker image is like a blueprint or recipe for creating a container. It includes everything your app needs to run—code, tools, libraries, and settings—all packed into one file.
* You can't run an image by itself; you use it to create a container, which is the running, live version of that blueprint.
* `docker images` : to see the list of images we have locally
* `docker pull hello-world` : to get the image of specified public image.
* `docker run hello-world` : to run that image on a container.
* `docker login` : it s used to login with our account. use PAT

i have also try using mysql using following commands
```
docker pull mysql
#for running the mysql image on container but we have to give them pasword
docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root mysql
# for running it in backgroud -d is used
docker run -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root mysql
#to stop the containers we use
docker stop <container-id>
```
## 6. Writing Dockerfile for java sample project for creating image 
* `git clone https://github.com/LondheShubham153/simple-java-docker.git`
* Creting Dockerfile
```
# this is a base of the application  
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine

# to create a directory in container
WORKDIR /app

# to copy the source code from local to container directory
COPY src/Main.java /app/Main.java

# to compilke the code 
RUN javac Main.java

# to run the java application
CMD ["java", "Main"]

```
* Dockerfile to Docker image
`docker build -t <image-name> <Dockerfile-path>`
> NOTE : It is also used to update the code

* To run the docker image
`docker run <image-name>`

* to delete the image
`docker rmi -f <image-id/name>`
